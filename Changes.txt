Beta 3
===============

- Applied David Bachmann's patch fixing FACILITIES-88
  "Remove NH Facility dependency on NHibernate.Mapping.Attribute.dll"

- Applied patch from Brian Chan 
  "NHibernate.Mapping.Attribute Support"

- Fixed FACILITIES-80
  "Isolation Mode not applied when integrated with Transaction Services"

- Fixed FACILITIES-54
  "Integrate NHibernate facility with NHibernate 1.2"

- Applied Curtis Schlak's patch fixing FACILITIES-52
  "Factory-Specific IInterceptors"

  Quoting: "To use a factory-specific interceptor, include a component with an id of

  nhibernate.session.interceptor.<alias_name>

  where <alias_name> is the alias used for the factory that you would like 
  the interceptor to act upon."

- Applied Michal Levy's patch fixing FACILITIES-51
  "When using more than one session inside transaction, only first session is 
   registered in NH transaction context"

- Added more transactions test cases

- Applied Ernst Naezer's patch that adds support for configurable flushModes.

  On the facility configuration node, you can specify the following attribute:

    defaultFlushModel="Auto|Commit|Never"

- Removed RegisterSessionFactory from ISessionManager

- Used https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cuyahoga/trunk/Core/Facilities/ as inspiration
  to add support for rebuildable session factories
 
- You can now control the NH's ReflectionOptimizer through the attribute useReflectionOptimizer which goes on the facility node.

- The DefaultSessionManager will always look up for a component "nhibernate.session.interceptor" to use as
  a NH Interceptor
  
- The NH Facility will always look up for a component "nhibernate.sessionfactory.interceptor" and 
  associate the instance with the Configuration.Interceptor before creating the session factories
